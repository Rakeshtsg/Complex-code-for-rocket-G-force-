This code reads sensor values from an altitude sensor, temperature sensor, accelerometer, and gyroscope. It then checks if the readings are within acceptable ranges and triggers alarms and warning lights if necessary. Of course, this is just one possible implementation and you may need to modify the code to suit your specific needs.
